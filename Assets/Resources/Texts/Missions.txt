This is the most important task! You need to secure tickets to the CANDY concert and apparently there’s only 1 left, so let’s join the queue for ticketing. Word of advice: keep clicking that BUY button!

It’s time to familiarize yourself with CANDY songs by creating an exclusive playlist that you can listen to on loop. You will be shuffling through some K-Pop songs, but it’s up to you to keep the playlist organized and add only the ones by CANDY.

There’s only a few days left before the concert, but you need to memorize the fanchants for each CANDY title track. In order to do so, type out the displayed fanchant as quickly and accurately as you can!
